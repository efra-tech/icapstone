        <h1>Project Proposal: An Underground Musician Web Application</h1>

        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            In a city with as prevalent a music culture as Seattle, it is no surprise that there are tons of bustling underground music scenes here. From EDM to grungy punk,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Seattle" target="_blank">small musicians are a core of Seattle’s cultural soul</a>, and the “underground” is filled with young and inspired musicians who are pushing boundaries every day. However,
            for many musicians, networking and logistics are a large barrier to creativity and can make the scene feel secular and clique-y. With most get-togethers and house shows
            being negotiated via word of mouth, social media posts, and direct messaging groups, it’s hard to enter new music scenes without having an “in” through an existing member.
            We want to provide a private, secure and flexible solution for upcoming musicians to easily find new collaborators and advertise concerts while avoiding the headache that
            networking and organizing can give.
        </p>
        <p>
	        Our solution will be built like a social media application, with a focus on things musicians like; we take inspiration from small music forums such as
            <a href="https://www.kanyetothe.com/forums/" target="_blank">kanyetothe</a>, the Kanye West centric forum that members of the rap group BROCKHAMPTON originally met on, to provide collaborative spaces for musicians to discuss techniques,
            form collaborations, advertise themselves and their live performances, and just generally foster a welcoming community. We also want to provide an easier way to post
            about upcoming events and manage ticketing prices, concert rosters, and any other logistics that may come up when planning a live show.
        </p>

        <h2>Application Description</h2>
        <p>
            The main users of the application are small artists who are struggling with entering the underground scene, due to current methods of advertising being almost entirely connections-based. By providing a secure site anyone can access, musicians of any genre and size can attempt to find an audience for their music, or find other musicians to collaborate with. Another group of users will be the people searching for new local artists, which they can find through attending various shows advertised on the website. The users will be viewing user-submitted data in the form of event cards posted by various artists. By clicking on the events that interest them, users can then view additional details regarding the show, including location, date, time, and any additional artists performing at the event. For recruiting purposes, users can view advertisements created by artists looking for other musicians to form groups with or to organize events with.
        </p>
        <p>
            Musician users will be able to use the web app to gain a greater audience and support of their music.
            They will be able to use an interactive feature that allows them to share posts about their act and upcoming concerts they might organize, and will be able to manage data about who is going to the concert as well as ticket payments.
            The users will also have the ability to use a secure direct messaging feature that connects them to other similar musician users, in order to organize local events alongside them.
            Furthermore, a filter feature can aid users who are looking for nearby concerts curated to their music interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            Local artists typically find it hard to safely find similar artist groups and support from communities; our app will help in solving these issues that small artists face by providing them a secure way to easily organize concerts and discover connections with other users who share similar passions for entertainment in the underground scene.
            The app will act as an interactive bridge between artists and supporters to create a community.
